# ACDLCPicker

This script picks a random DLC item to distribute and on the 1st and 16th of every month (in our setup), the script will run and pack the item to be distribute with RiiConnect24.

It depends on [ACWC24](https://github.com/SunakazeKun/ACWC24) by Aurum (aka SunakazeKun). The BIN files were generated with [ACDLC](https://github.com/SunakazeKun/ACDLC), also made by the same person.
